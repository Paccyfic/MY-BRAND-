            <h2>AFRICA’S BIGGEST HUB FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP...</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-txt">
            <p>Norrsken House Kigali is built on the former historic Ecole Belge, located right in downtown Kigali. It consists of repurposed classrooms, as well as a main building, which together form the largest hub for entrepreneurship on the continent. The place where you spend most of your time needs to be functional, adaptable and, not least, beautiful. That's why we've poured our hearts into making this a space that you'll want to come back to every morning.
            </p><br>
            <p>Within this context, Norrsken Foundation’s mission is to help entrepreneurs solve the world’s greatest challenges. “We want to raise the status of being an entrepreneur,” says Erik Engellau-Nilsson, Norrsken Foundation’s Chief Executive. In 2018, Norrsken partnered with MASS to launch the Norrsken Kigali House, a new entrepreneurship hub in Kigali, Rwanda. A collaborative engagement process informed the campus design, beginning with the question, “How can an entrepreneurial workspace become a catalyst for rapid, just,and inclusive economic transformation in the region?” </p><br>
            <p>The new Norrsken hub is housed on the historic École Belge site in central Kigali, and marks the first adaptive reuse project in the area. The École Belge de Kigali, established in 1965, is one of the oldest international schools in Rwanda and an educational pillar of the country. Following the school’s relocation to new premises, the existing site became one of a few mid-century properties remaining in Kigali’s Central Business District. With the historic classrooms and former school playgrounds at risk of being demolished for high-rise commercial use, MASS aimed to preserve the historic structure of the École Belge and illustrate how adaptive reuse could work within the neighborhood to create moments of green and public spaces. The campus design successfully prioritizes existing architecture and landscape, requiring only two trees in total to be cut down. It offers a new model of how restoration and mixed use development can occur in harmony, setting the tone for future redevelopment in the Central Business District.</p><br><br>
